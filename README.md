# AQI-Dashboard
This project involves creating a Delhi-specific Air Quality Monitoring Dashboard that breaks down AQI using multiple pollutants such as PM10, PM2.5, NO2, SO2, CO, and O3. Using Python, we simulate dummy data, which is visualized in Tableau and embedded in a live web interface. The dashboard also provides AQI advisories to help users understand the health impacts based on pollution levels.

📊 Key Features:
🏙️ Focused on Delhi zones: Rohini, Dwarka, CP, Lajpat Nagar, Saket, etc.

🧪 Includes major pollutants (PM10, PM2.5, NO2, SO2, CO, O3)

📈 Real-time-like simulation with timestamps

🧠 Displays AQI Advisory based on calculated AQI

📌 Shows average AQI and pollution severity

🌐 Fully deployed on a website using Tableau embed
- to check the live data check out the spreadsheet given below:-

-Run the python code first to generate the dummy data ,the time interval between 2 data is 60 seconds . so data is generated after 60 seconds
